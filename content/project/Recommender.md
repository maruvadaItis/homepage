**Project Idea Proposal:**
<p align="justify">
The Mood Movie recommender system will be built on the Moviellens 20M data set posted by the MovieLens website(http://movielens.org).The dataset can be found here at:https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/.20 million ratings and 465,000 tag applications applied to 27,000 movies by 138,000 users.Includes tag genome data with 12 million relevance scores across 1,100 tags. 

**Why this idea?**
Movies and Entertainment play a very vital role in our lives. Can you imagine a world without Movies ,T.V series , etc life would be too boring I guess.In this world of 21st century when there is so much widespread of smartphones and smart screens with internet facility entertainment on personal screens has become quite common and in such case who would not like to have a personalised experience in movie viewing. All the big online entertainment providers like Netflix,Amazonprimevideo,Hulu,Sling give their viewers a personalized experience to enhance thier viewing experience. Just imagine if we get to know more about our viewers , their mood patterns,their login time, their past history, ratings and based on thier on screen activity which is the future scope of this Movie recommendation sytem , I feel we can be better at giving preferences to the viewers and thereby making their viewing experience even more better.
