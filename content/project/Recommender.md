**Project Idea Proposal:**
<p align="justify>
Recommender systems have become ubiquitous in our lives.Yet, currently, they are far from optimal.In this project we will try make a movie recommendation system. A system that not only gives you the choices of movies to watch from but also takes into consideration lot of other factors that can enhance our movie viewing experience. Keeping in mind the overall human behaviour these factors can actually make a huge difference in recommending us a perfect and accurate match of movies.These days recommender sytems are gaining lot of attention and why not ?. These systems actually try knowing our preferences based on our history,ratings,acctivity and comes out with the best possible data that a user actually wants to view.But the question still remains that HOW WELL CAN THEY PREDICT? Naturally to predict something you must study it over period of time.Studying helps you know about the activity,behaviour,likingness,dislikingness etc.

In this very Movie recommendation system we take into consideration various factors like mood of the user which will be defined by the user himself, time of the day that will be noted based on login time, Preferences based on ratings given by the user and even the other users using collaborative filtering, and using content based filtering for keywords and attributes.
          


The recommender system will be built on the Moviellens 20M data set posted by the MovieLens web site (http://movielens.org).  dataset that has been posted by Jessica Li. The dataset can be found here at:https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/.  20 million ratings and 465,000 tag applications applied to 27,000 movies by 138,000 users.Includes tag genome data with 12 million relevance scores across 1,100 tags. 

**Why this idea?**

The internet has taken humanity by storm and has changed the way people live life completely. The smartphone is a catalyst to this revolution. Everyone can afford a smartphone and stay connected to the internet constantly at cost effective prices in India. This can pave the path to know what medications one is supposed to use, accurately and in a safe manner. **PharmEasy** recommendation system is for the people of the world, for the people who do not have immediate access to medical help due to unforeseen circumstances, to keep themselves healthy, fit and live easier in a smarter way. Data mining with machine learning makes this conveniently possible.
