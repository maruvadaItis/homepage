**Why this idea?**
<p align="justify">Movies and Entertainment play a very vital role in our lives.Can you imagine a world without Movies?life would be too boring,I guess?In this world of 21st century there is a widespread use of smartphones and smartscreens with internet facility in it.In an era like this,were entertainment on personal screens has become common and therefore having a personalized experience during movie viewing has become important too for a better viewing experience. All the big online entertainment providers like Netflix, Amazonprimevideo, Hulu,Sling give their viewers a personalized experience to enhance their viewing experience. Just imagine if we get to know more about our viewers,their login time,their history,ratings etc. I feel we can be better at giving preferences to the viewers and thereby making their viewing experience even better.
