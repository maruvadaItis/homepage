**Why this idea?**
<p align="justify">Movies and Entertainment play a very vital role in our lives.Can you imagine a world without Movies,T.V series,life would be too boring,I guess?In this world of 21st century there is a widespread use of smartphones and smartscreens with internet facility in it.In an era like this,were entertainment on personal screens has become common and therefore having a personalized experience during movie viewing has become important too for a better viewing experience.All the big online entertainment providers like Netflix,Amazonprimevideo,Hulu,Sling give their viewers a personalized experience to enhance their viewing experience.Just imagine if we get to know more about our viewers,their mood patterns,their login time,their history,ratings etc.Studying patterns and datasets generated by the movie postercover images selected by the user to predict his/her mood and suggest movies (horror,action,comedy etc)and even studying their on screen activity are of course the future scope of this Movie recommendation system.I feel we can be better at giving preferences to the viewers and thereby making their viewing experience even better.
